It provides a forum to researchers and practitioners in SAND in Europe and beyond – to interact, collaborate and develop the systems analysis and design area.<br>The event has the hybrid form – the accepted papers can be presented at the venue site or by videoconferencing.<br>The EuroSymposium is currently headed by the Advisory Board and International Programme Committee composed of prominent researchers to guide this initiative.<br>Therefore, there are three organizers of the 9th EuroSymposium on Systems Analysis and Design are as follows:<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SIGSAND is the Association for Information Systems (AIS) Special Interest Group on Systems Analysis and Design. SIGSAND provides services such as annual symposia, news, research and teaching tracks at major IS conferences, listserv and special issues in journals. The EuroSymposia were initiated by the past AIS Vice President Prof. Keng Siau as the SIGSAND-Europe Initiative.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Polish Chapter of Association for Information Systems (PLAIS) was established in 2006 as the joint initiative of Prof. Claudia Loebbecke, University of Cologne, Germany, former President of AIS and Prof. Stanisław Wrycza, University of Gdansk, Poland. PLAIS co-organizes international and domestic conferences on systems analysis and design as well as on Business Informatics and Systems Engineering.<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Department of Business Informatics of the University of Gdansk is conducting intensive teaching and research activities. The Department is also active internationally, organizing conferences including the 10th European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS 2002), The 7th International Conference on Perspectives in Business Informatics Research (BIR 2008), The 8th International Conference on European Distance and E-learning Network (EDEN 2009) and 24th Conference on Advance Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2012). The Department is the partner of the European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS) consortium.<br><br>RELEVANT TOPICS<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Agile Methods,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Big Data,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Business Intelligence,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Business Process Modeling,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cloud Computing,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cognitive Issues in SAND,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Conceptual Modeling,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crowdsourcing Models,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Design of Mobile Applications,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Design Theory,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Empirical Studies in SAND,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ethical and&nbsp; Human Aspects of IS Development,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Human-Computer Interaction,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Information Systems Development: Methods and Techniques,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Internet of Things,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knowledge Management,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Model-Driven Architecture,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Modeling Languages,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ontological Foundations of Systems Analysis and Design,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Open Source Software (OSS) Solutions,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Project Management,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rapid Systems Development,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Requirements Engineering,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Research Methodologies in SAND,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SAND in ERP and CRM Systems,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SCRUM,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Security Issues in Systems Analysis and Design,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA),<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Social Media, Networking and Analytics,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Teaching Systems Analysis and Design,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;UML, SysML, BPMN,<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Workflow Management.<br><br>ADVISORY BOARD<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wil van der Aalst, Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;David Avison, ESSEC Business School, France<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Joerg Becker, University of Muenster, Germany<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jane Fedorowicz, Bentley University, USA<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dimitris Karagiannis, University of Vienna, Austria<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie Kendall, Rutgers University, USA<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helmut Krcmar, Technische Universität Muenchen, Germany<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia Loebbecke, University of Cologne, Germany<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keng Siau, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA<br><br>INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMME COMMITTEE<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stanislaw Wrycza University of Gdansk, Poland - chairman<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eduard Babkin, Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Akhilesh Bajaj, University of Tulsa, USA<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Palash Bera, Saint Louis University, USA<br>•&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Patrick Y.K.
